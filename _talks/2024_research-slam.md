The MIT Research Slam is a research presentation that builds on the classic “elevator pitch” or 3 Minute Thesis (3MT) competition. Presenters explain their research to a curious, non-specialist audience in ≤3 minutes (strictly enforced) using one slide with no animation, video, or props. This competition is offered in more than 200 universities in more than 85 countries of the world. For the 2024 edition, I got selected to compete based on a video of my pitch. I further won both the first jury price and the general audience award!
